# Python code for Raspberry Pi 3 b with OpenCV for video surveillance with USB camera.

I have used OpenCV library to create the videos.

I have used a 32Gb SD card, for this reason, the life time of the videos is only 1 day.

I didn't execute this code for more than 1 day so, be careful with high temperature of CPU and with overwrite SD for long time.
